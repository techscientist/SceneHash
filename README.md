### Description:
Created during the Insight Data Science Fellows Program, SceneHash is a web application for finding local music events. I developed a “music2vec” model to facilitate comparisons among genres, artists, and venues, and employed k-means clustering algorithm with scikit-learn. Combined Flask, Leaflet.js, and jQuery to create interactive an web application deployed on AWS.
